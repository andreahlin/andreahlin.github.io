         <h1>WHO IS SHE?</h1>
          <p>I am a maker! Depending on the day, that could look like building well-designed software, 
              creating artwork, or experimenting with different mediums, both digital and analog. I 
              bring an attitude of curiosity, empathy, and excellence to each challenge I encounter. </p>
              
             <p> I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a BSE in computer graphics. 
              I am currently a software engineer at Elsevier. </p>
